# Codex Agent Operating Guidelines

- Scope: Do not read/write/delete anything outside this repository workspace.
- Iteration: Work in small, validated increments; verify each change before moving on.
- Timeouts: Set an expectation for runtime before executing code. If a process exceeds the expected time (never longer than 30 minutes), terminate it and investigate.
